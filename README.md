# Solidity Assessment

This solidity program is coded by me which covers all bases of solidity language. Here we are going to learn about functions, mapping, if-else conditions, creation of variables, and their data-types.

## Description

This is a simple program where we created a contract named MyToken. contract is code that contains functions and variables. Mapping is done using its syntax and two functions named mint and burn are created which helps in adding and subtracting value from the balance of user with their following account address.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

Type the code after creating new file and assign it a name in Remix which is used to code in Solidity language.

Now after creating a new file and typing the code click Compile(name) then you will be able to see a green tick which means compiled successfully only if your code has no problems.

Now you need to go to deploy and run and then click on deploy button present over there which will deploy your solidity code and then you can see your result to the code in solidity language.

At the end you will be able to retrieve your result
